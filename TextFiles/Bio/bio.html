In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 <a href="/wiki/Oil_painting" title="Oil painting">oil paintings</a>, most of which date from the last two years of his life. They include <a href="/wiki/Trees_and_Undergrowth_(Van_Gogh_series)" class="mw-redirect" title="Trees and Undergrowth (Van Gogh series)">landscapes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Still_life_paintings_by_Vincent_van_Gogh_(Paris)" title="Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Paris)">still lifes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Portraits_by_Vincent_van_Gogh" title="Portraits by Vincent van Gogh">portraits</a> and <a href="/wiki/Portraits_of_Vincent_van_Gogh" title="Portraits of Vincent van Gogh">self-portraits</a>, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive <a href="/wiki/Paintwork" class="mw-redirect" title="Paintwork">brushwork</a> that contributed to the foundations of <a href="/wiki/Modern_art" title="Modern art">modern art</a>. He was not commercially successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness, depression and poverty.
</p><p>Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet, and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a <a href="/wiki/Protestant" class="mw-redirect" title="Protestant">Protestant</a> missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother <a href="/wiki/Theo_van_Gogh_(art_dealer)" title="Theo van Gogh (art dealer)">Theo</a> supported him financially, and the two kept a <a href="/wiki/The_Letters_of_Vincent_van_Gogh" title="The Letters of Vincent van Gogh">long correspondence by letter</a>. His early works, mostly <a href="/wiki/Still_life_paintings_by_Vincent_van_Gogh_(Netherlands)" title="Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Netherlands)">still lifes</a> and depictions of <a href="/wiki/Peasant_Character_Studies_(Van_Gogh_series)" title="Peasant Character Studies (Van Gogh series)">peasant labourers</a>, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the <i><a href="/wiki/Avant-garde" title="Avant-garde">avant-garde</a></i>, including <a href="/wiki/%C3%89mile_Bernard_(painter)" class="mw-redirect" title="Émile Bernard (painter)">Émile Bernard</a> and <a href="/wiki/Paul_Gauguin" title="Paul Gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a>, who were reacting against the <a href="/wiki/Impressionist" class="mw-redirect" title="Impressionist">Impressionist</a> sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and <a href="/wiki/Montmartre_(Van_Gogh_series)" title="Montmartre (Van Gogh series)">local landscapes</a>. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in <a href="/wiki/Arles" title="Arles">Arles</a> in the south of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of <a href="/wiki/Olive_Trees_(Van_Gogh_series)" title="Olive Trees (Van Gogh series)">olive trees</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wheat_Fields_(Van_Gogh_series)" class="mw-redirect" title="Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)">wheat fields</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sunflowers_(Van_Gogh_series)" title="Sunflowers (Van Gogh series)">sunflowers</a>.
</p><p>Van Gogh suffered from <a href="/wiki/Psychosis" title="Psychosis">psychotic episodes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Delusion" title="Delusion">delusions</a> and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at <a href="/wiki/Saint-R%C3%A9my-de-Provence" title="Saint-Rémy-de-Provence">Saint-Rémy</a>. After he discharged himself and moved to the <a href="/wiki/Auberge_Ravoux" title="Auberge Ravoux">Auberge Ravoux</a> in <a href="/wiki/Auvers-sur-Oise" title="Auvers-sur-Oise">Auvers-sur-Oise</a> near Paris, he came under the care of the <a href="/wiki/Homeopathy" title="Homeopathy">homeopathic</a> doctor <a href="/wiki/Paul_Gachet" title="Paul Gachet">Paul Gachet</a>. His depression continued and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a <a href="/wiki/Lefaucheux" class="mw-redirect" title="Lefaucheux">Lefaucheux</a> revolver.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> He died from his injuries two days later.
</p><p>Van Gogh was unsuccessful during his lifetime, and he was considered a madman and a failure. He became famous after his suicide and exists in the public imagination as a misunderstood genius, the artist "where discourses on madness and creativity converge".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMcQuillan19899_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcQuillan19899-8">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> His reputation began to grow in the early 20th century as elements of his painting style came to be incorporated by the <a href="/wiki/Fauvism" title="Fauvism">Fauves</a> and <a href="/wiki/German_Expressionism" class="mw-redirect" title="German Expressionism">German Expressionists</a>. He attained widespread critical, commercial and popular success over the ensuing decades, and he is remembered as an important but tragic painter, whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the <a href="/wiki/Tortured_artist" title="Tortured artist">tortured artist</a>. Today, Van Gogh's works are among the <a href="/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_paintings" title="List of most expensive paintings">world's most expensive paintings to have ever sold</a>, and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name, the <a href="/wiki/Van_Gogh_Museum" title="Van Gogh Museum">Van Gogh Museum</a> in <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, which holds the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.
